## Source Code
To view the source code, navigate between the desired branches, and the source will be viewable there. The master branch of this project is simply just used for information and miscellaneous mod-wide files.

## Setting up a Workspace/Compiling from Source
Perhaps you are interested in getting the most up to date version of the mod possible, or are interested in modifying the mod to fit your own standards, here are some basic instructions for getting started.

* Setup: Download the source and run `gradlew [setupDecompWorkspace|setupDevWorkspace] [eclipse|idea]`
* Build: Download the source and run `gradlew build`

Distributing a customized version of Levels publicly is forbidden. You may, however, use your customized version and share it with friends privately. You also may not distribute a compiled version of the mod yourself either. If you have any questions regarding this, just let me know.

## Issue Reporting
Please follow this format, even if loosely, when reporting issues. This just saves myself time asking you questions about what version you are running and things like that.
