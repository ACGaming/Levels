### About Levels
Levels is an innovative mod, centered around the concept of leveling systems, combined with adding many new features to the combat system within Minecraft. With Levels, you will be able to level up all of your weapons, swords and axes, along with tools and armor. On top of this, enemies will also become leveled, giving the option of a more challenging experience.

Through all of these additions, Levels strives to create a unique system in which allows your weapons to become fully customizable and insanely powerful. On top of that, we are striving to create something highly adaptable, in other words, compatible with almost every other mod that adds weapons, tools, armors, and even monsters.

### Features
At the base of the mod, Levels implements a rarity system. This system essentially determines how powerful the base stats of the item or monster are, with higher rarities being more powerful, while being much more rare. On top of this, items will also be able to gain experience, earn levels, and unlock powerful abilities for you to explore and use.
