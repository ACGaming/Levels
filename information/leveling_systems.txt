### Weapon Leveling System
Weapons have a max of six levels, and gain experience by successfully using a weapon. Dealing the killing
blow will also result in a bonus of experience to the weapon (10 for monsters; 2 for animals). Weapons will
also (in the future) have different rarities, each rarity granting different passive abilities (extra damage,
etc).

Each level has a different amount of experience needed to level up. For example, view this chart below:

Level 2 ---> 1000
Level 3 ---> 2500
Level 4 ---> 5000
Level 5 ---> 10000
Level 6 ---> 20000

Everytime your weapon is leveled up, an algorithm is run to determine which ability gets added (one will always
be added, except in one case). At lower levels, the chance of getting an A1 ability (Lower category: Fire/Frost)
is really high. If you have a higher rarity level, this will also affect which ability you get. Ancient weapons
are more likely to receive an A3 ability (Ethereal/Void) than Basic weapons. Sometimes, you might not get an
ability. If that is the case, it just means that the algorithm picked an ability you already have, resulting
in nothing being added.

Once you reach the max of level 6, you now will not be able to gain more experience. It will rather say "Max"
instead.

You can view the available abilities in the abilities.txt file.
