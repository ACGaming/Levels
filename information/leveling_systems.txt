### Weapon Leveling System
####
Weapons have a max of 20 levels, and gain experience by successfully using a weapon. Dealing the killing
blow will also result in a bonus of experience to the weapon (10 for monsters; 2 for animals). Weapons
also have different rarities, each rarity granting different passive abilities (extra damage,
etc).

Each level has a different amount of experience needed to level up. For example, view this chart below:

Level 2 ---> 50
Level 3 ---> 125
Level 4 ---> 225
Level 5 ---> 375
Level 6 ---> 600
Level 7 ---> 925
Level 8 ---> 1375
Level 9 ---> 2000
Level 10 --> 2850
Level 11 --> 4000
Level 12 --> 5550
Level 13 --> 7625
Level 14 --> 10400
Level 15 --> 14100
Level 16 --> 19025
Level 17 --> 25575
Level 18 --> 34275
Level 19 --> 45825
Level 20 --> 61150

Once you reach the max of level 20, you now will not be able to gain more experience. It will rather say "Max"
instead.

You can view the available abilities in the abilities.txt file.

### Weapon Rarities
####
Whenever you craft a weapon, you will see "Unknown" on the tooltip. This is your weapons rarity. Once you kill a monster,
that rarity will be uncovered, resulting in 1 of 5 possible rarities (Basic, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, and Ancient). The
higher your rarity, the better you weapon will be, resulting in potentially more damage, chances of negating weapon 
durability damage, or even adding durability to your weapon. You'll even have higher chances of getting those higher
ranked abilities assuming your rarity is high enough.
