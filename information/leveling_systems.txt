### Levels Leveling Systems ###

####
### Weapon Leveling System
####
Weapons have a max of six levels, and gain experience by successfully using a weapon. Dealing the killing
blow will also result in a bonus of experience to the weapon (10 for monsters; 2 for animals). Weapons will
also (in the future) have different rarities, each rarity granting different passive abilities (extra damage,
etc).

Each level has a different amount of experience needed to level up. For example, view this chart below:

Level 2 ---> 1000
Level 3 ---> 2500
Level 4 ---> 5000
Level 5 ---> 10000
Level 6 ---> 20000

Everytime your weapon is leveled up, an algorithm is run to determine which ability gets added (one will always
be added, except in one case). At lower levels, the chance of getting an A1 ability (Lower category: Fire/Frost)
is really high. If you have a higher rarity level, this will also affect which ability you get. Ancient weapons
are more likely to receive an A3 ability (Ethereal/Void) than Basic weapons. Sometimes, you might not get an
ability. If that is the case, it just means that the algorithm picked an ability you already have, resulting
in nothing being added.

Once you reach the max of level 6, you now will not be able to gain more experience. It will rather say "Max"
instead.

You can view the available abilities in the abilities.txt file.

### Armor Leveling System
####
Weapons also have a max of six levels, and gain experience by being damaged by living entities. Each time you are
*hurt* by an enemy, you'll gain two experience points per piece of armor being worn, though the higher your level,
the higher the chance you'll get a bonus of one or more experience points. Armors also will have rarities (in the
future) which will be explained once that is ready.

Each level has a different amount of experience needed to level up. For example, view this chart below:

Level 2 ---> 100
Level 3 ---> 250
Level 4 ---> 500
Level 5 ---> 1000
Level 6 ---> 2000

Everytime your armor is leveled up, an algorithm is run to determine which ability gets added (one will always
be added, except in one case). At lower levels, the chance of getting an A1 ability (Lower category: Hardened/Poisoned)
is really high. If you have a higher rarity level, this will also affect which ability you get. Ancient armors
are more likely to receive an A3 ability (Ethereal/Void) than Basic armors. Sometimes, you might not get an
ability. If that is the case, it just means that the algorithm picked an ability you already have, resulting
in nothing being added.

Once you reach the max of level 6, you now will not be able to gain more experience. It will rather say "Max"
instead.

You can view the available abilities in the abilities.txt file.

### Weapon Rarities
####
Whenever you craft a weapon, you will see "Unknown" on the tooltip. This is your weapons rarity. Once you kill a monster,
that rarity will be uncovered, resulting in 1 of 5 possible rarities (Basic, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, and Ancient). The
higher your rarity, the better you weapon will be, resulting in potentially more damage, chances of negating weapon 
durability damage, or even adding durability to your weapon. You'll even have higher chances of getting those higher
ranked abilities assuming your rarity is high enough.
