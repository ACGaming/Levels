    * Why not continue the leveling theme one step further. Enemies will now be spawned with varying levels too. Some
    * levels will be easier than normal monsters, though others will be much more powerful. The more powerful the
    * monster, the better loot that can be received, amongst experience bonuses and such. Enemy levels will be released
    * in the abilities.txt file too.
