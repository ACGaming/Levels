### Levels Planned Features ###
###############################

### Release 1 - Initial Release
r1.2.0
- Armor Rarities
    * Armor rarities perform exactly how weapons work. Reference that instead. Different bonuses will likely be given
    * however.

r1.3.0
- Bow Leveling System and Rarities
    * Pretty self-explanatory. A bow leveling system with rarities. Bow abilities will be released in the abilities.txt
    * file.



### Release 2 - Enemy Leveling
r2.0.0
- Enemy Leveling Systems
    * Why not continue the leveling theme one step further. Enemies will now be spawned with varying levels too. Some
    * levels will be easier than normal monsters, though others will be much more powerful. The more powerful the
    * monster, the better loot that can be received, amongst experience bonuses and such. Enemy levels will be released
    * in the abilities.txt file too.
